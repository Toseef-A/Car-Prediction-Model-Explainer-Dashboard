# Global Intelligent Systems Practical Project  

This project was developed for the Global Intelligent Systems module at University Academy 92. The practical assessment involved analysing Bento Motorsâ€™ business data using Artificial Intelligence techniques.
Key tasks included data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models for prediction and evaluation. The project compared multiple algorithms, applied cross-validation,
and used model interpretation techniques such as SHAP to ensure transparency and ethical AI practices. Results were documented in a reproducible Jupyter/Colab notebook with supporting analysis.
